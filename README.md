# Natural-Language_Processing
# An effort to train a recurrent neural network to perform sentiment analysis on yelp reviews

Natural Language Processing has over recent years become an exceptionally exciting field within machine learning and artificial intelligence. The applications to processing language itself are more than enough to generate interest, but the ability to use the models abstractly has garnered the field of NLP much popular interest. Companies like google for example have put great effort towards developing algorithms such as GPT-3 an exceptionally versatile and powerful language model used primarly to generate human-like text. 

This jupyter notebook is a farcry from something as complex as GPT-3 but serves as a personal attempt at understanding both the coding involved aswell as the architecture and mathematics that serve as the foundation for the algorithms that drive these powerful tools.
